/*
Write a function that converts a floating point number to a string.

JavaScript: you can do the conversion with the String() function.
Python: you can do this conversion with the str() function.
The number could be negative, but the built-in conversion function should handle this.

Example

Input:
f == 12.345

Output:
"12.345"  (as a string)
*/

// My Solution
function solution(f) {
    var str = f.toString();
    
    return str;
}
