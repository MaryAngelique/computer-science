/*
Write a function that performs a sequence of mathematical operations by reassigning the results into the same variable.

Even though this could be a one-liner, only use a single additional variable for this, and do each step as an independent operation.

Add 7 to the number.
Divide the result by 2 (the result could be fractional).
Multiply that result by 5.
*/

// My Solution
function solution(n) {
    return ((n + 7) / 2 * 5)
}
